<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This case study is the Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused smart products for women since 2013. The company has 5 focus products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.
